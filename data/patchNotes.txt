5.17.19
Updated player control system: Can now walk in multiple directions
Updated player control bug: Will travel in the correct direction as key pressed
Added "Display" class, where text can be displayed across a period of time

	        Change display from frames to milliseconds, eventually get rid of lag allow and do the same?
	        Try to do that, or else the battle will run on different speeds on different computers
	        Display text doesn't reset between screen changes, fix this. You can make display.n = 0 upon screen changes or something
		Get rid of "timer++". Create new variable "currentTime". Every time we set timer = 0, instead make currentTime = millis();. Make timer = millis() - currentTime;
	      
Next time ----> Reset everything upon player exit battle, e.g. button select, enemyTurn, playerTurn, battle interface, etc.
